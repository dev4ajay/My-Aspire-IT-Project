                    <p align="justify">

Aspire IIT & Medical offers direct admission option in all of its courses. The direct admission is provided on the basis of percentage of marks secured by the student in his/her School/ Board Examination... Each course has a predefined specific percentage admission criterion. Broadly, for any course a student should fulfil the given percentage or grades requirement in either Science & Maths (aggregate) in Class IX/ Class X Board/ SSC exam, or PCB/PCM (aggregate) in class XII Board/ HSC examination. For example, in Two Year Integrated Program for Medical (NEET) or Engineering (JEE-Main & Advanced) Entrance Exams, a minimum of 70% marks or B1+B1 grades in Class IX/ Class X Board/ SSC in Science & Maths (aggregate) is required. If a student, whose score is equal to or more than this percentage or grades will be given direct admission in this course. If a student has not scored a minimum of 70% marks or B1+B1 grades in Class IX/ Class X Board/ SSC in Science & Maths (aggregate), then he/she will have to appear for our ‘Aspire IIT & Medical Talent Search Exam’. Those students who qualify this test are then given admission in the applied courses.

Please discuss with Centre Counsellors for further details.

                    <p align="justify">Aspire IIT & Medical also offers admission to those students who could not perform well in their board exams and want another chance to showcase their potential for medicine or engineering as career. For such students, we have a provision of an admission test, where we test the basic knowledge of the student. The syllabus of the admission test is different for different courses and can be obtained from the information desk at the concerned / applying centre. The admission test also gives an opportunity to a student to outperform and get scholarship in turn. A student, who has qualified our direct admission criteria, can also appear for ATSE in order to avail scholarship. If a student has taken direct admission and paid registration fee, admission fee and 1st installment of the tuition fee, then he/she cannot appear in ATSE to avail any scholarship benefit. A student can appear in the ATSE for a maximum of two chances for seeking admission in a particular course. </p>
