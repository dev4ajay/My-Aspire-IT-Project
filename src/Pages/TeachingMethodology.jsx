1. Total Lectures Per Week: 04 to 07.<br/><br/>

2. Total Lectures Per Week Per Subject (Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics each): 3 to 6<br/><br/>

3. Each lecture consists of 90-105 Minutes duration (01 Hr 30 Min. to 01 Hr 45 Min)<br/><br/>

4. The 105 Minutes of each lecture is divided as follows: First 20 Min for Daily Practice Problem (DPP) Discussion; Next 35 Minutes for Sheet/Module Discussion and last 50 Minutes are devoted for theoretical and conceptual learning.<br/><br/>

5. The Discussion part is more of interactive type and students are motivated to raise and discuss their doubts/objections to understand the concepts/fundamentals used in problem solving.<br/><br/>

6. Theoretical learning consist of Theory coupled with important concepts /fundamentals, formulae and is taught through solved/ unsolved examples/illustrations and derivations.<br/><br/>

7. The Faculty Members take help from and largely followed standardized Lecture Notes while delivering their lecture. This helps in synchronized teaching in all the batches across the course/study centres.<br/><br/>

8. Exhaustive & detailed Class Notes are prepared by the students in the Classroom for all topics which almost eliminates the need of any other study material.<br/><br/>

9. Appropriate Home Work is assigned in the form of Daily Practice Problems (DPPs), Problems from the Sheet and Problems from some standard/NCERT books.<br/><br/>

10. The assigned home work is discussed in the next class with interactive participation of the students.

1. Daily Practice Problems are popularly known as DPPs. It is a set of Problems assigned to the student as a part of the Home Work and is to be attempted at home.<br/><br/>

2. The objective of DPP is to revise all the concepts which have been taught till date.<br/><br/>

3. Typically a DPP contains 20 -30 Problems (on an average 25 Problems). It includes all variety of problems like Single Choice, Multiple Choice, Short Subjective, Long Subjective, Match the Column, Comprehension, Assertion & Reason, True & False, Fill in the Blanks and Miscellaneous Type. Further, DPPs can be changed according to the JEE (Main+Advanced)/JEE(Main)/ NEET(AIPMT) pattern.<br/><br/>

4.Around 03 DPPs Per Week Per Subject are given for all the three subjects (P, C, M & B). Hence, a student typically gets about 100 DPPs in each subject in a year. Hence, DPPs are like ' Boond Boond Se Ghada Bharta Hai (Many a pickle makes a mickle)'. A student can learn and practice around 25X100X3 = 7500 Problems in a year.<br/><br/>

5. Each DPP is assigned with Total Time/Marks (overall/question wise) for self-assessment.<br/><br/>

6. A DPP consists of questions mostly based upon the syllabus studied/learned in the previous lectures. Few problems in each DPP are also included from the topics previously taught for the continuous revision of old topics.<br/><br/>

7. The Discussion of problems of DPP is done in the next lecture. It boosts the morale of the student by doing sufficient practice of the theory taught in the classroom by practicing/solving the problems himself based upon that in the succeeding lectures.<br/><br/>

8. The problems of DPPs (with the same data or change in numerical data are revised in the Part Tests to firmly anchor the concepts.<br/><br/>

9. DPP gradually helps in developing a habit and practice of revision of the syllabus. The problems of DPPs can be marked/highlighted at the time of attempting so that they can work as an additional Question Bank and help in better revision before the JEE(Main+Advanced).<br/><br/>

10. The DPP is an important tool of <b> Aspire IIT & Medical </b> Classes's Teaching Methodology. Its importance can be understood by the fact that if a student attempts the DPP regularly with full sincerity and commitment; he/she may have more than 75% chances of getting selected in JEE(Main+Advanced)/JEE(Main)/NEET(AIPMT) with a good All India Rank (AIR).

1. A Sheet is typically a topic wise collection of problems in each subject i.e P, C, B & M. It is provided to the students as printed Study Material (topic wise).<br/><br/>

2. The objective of the Sheet is to achieve perfection in a topic while it is being taught through rigorous practice of variety of problems of various levels.<br/><br/>

3. The entire syllabus of JEE (Main+Advanced)/JEE (Main)/NEET (AIPMT) is approximately divided into 25 to 30 Sheets in each subject.<br/><br/>

4. The contents of the Sheet starts with summarized theory related to the particular topic; which is provided for a quick review of the topic.<br/><br/>

5. A students learns/attempts around 20000/15000 problems through Sheets in a two/one year course/programme respectively.<br/><br/>

6. Every Sheet includes problems which are sequentially segregated in exercise of four different levels. Exercise 1 comprises of conceptual problems which require fundamental knowledge of the topic; thus it helps the student feel confident about the preparation of that particular topic immediately he/ she complete the topic. It is further divided into two parts i.e. Part-A (Subjective Problems) & Part-B (Objective Problems). Each part is divided in various sequential section of the topic. In Exercise 2 the toughness of problems gradually increases. It is further divided into two parts i.e. Part-A (Subjective Problems) and Part-B (Objective Questions of Single Choice & Multiple Choice). The Exercise 3 further consists of 4-5 parts wherein variety of problems like Match the Column, Comprehension, Assertion & Reason, True & False and Fill in the Blanks etc. are included with the objective of practice of almost all the variety of problems. Exercise 4 consists of problems asked in JEE(Main+Advanced)/JEE(Main)/NEET(AIPMT) in last 10 Years<br/><br/>

7. The Answers for all the problems are provided at the end of the Sheet for reference to the students.<br/><br/>

8. After each Theory Class; the student is assigned to attempt some problems from the Sheet (keeping in mind around 15 Questions Per Lecture Per Subject) as Home Work. Further, these problems are discussed in the successive Theory Class for better understanding of the concepts/fundamentals of the portion of topic taught in the previous class.<br/><br/>

9. The selection of Problems is very specific in nature, covering each and every aspect of the theory and fundamentals/concepts of the topic.<br/><br/>

10. The contents of the Sheet ends with Miscellaneous Question Bank (MQB) - which is a set of additional but jumbled problems and is meant for those students who want more problems to practice. It is further divided into two parts i.e. MQB-I (Objective Questions) and MQB-II (Subjective Questions). The problems of MQB are not discussed in the Classroom but solutions of MQB are provided to the students.<br/><br/>
